config:
  description: |
    Consul is a service networking platform which provides service discovery, service mesh,
    and application configuration capabilities. The Consul provider exposes resources used
    to interact with a Consul cluster. Configuration of the provider is optional, as it provides
    reasonable defaults for all arguments.

    Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

    ~> **NOTE:** The Consul provider should not be confused with the [Consul remote
    state backend][consul-remote-state-backend], which is one of many backends that
    can be used to store Terraform state. The Consul provider is instead used to
    manage resources within Consul itself, such as adding external services or
    working with the key/value store.
